# Calculator

Very Simple and kinda cool calulator

# Version 1.0.0

## Run the Application
To run the application in the terminal run `go run main.go advanced.go basic.go <arg>`
The arg is either `basic` or `adv` to choose if you want the basic or advanced calculator  


### Explination
#### Basic
Basic is a just a simple calculator it takes in 3 int inputs
1. First Number
2. Number for operation choice
3. Second number
The App then evaluates the choice and does the math accordingly

#### Advanced
Advanced is not quite that advanced, it has yet to be updated however it only takes in 1 user input
1. Basic Expression
This consists of a left hand side (float64) character (byte) right hand side (float64) 
The application takes this in it then parses the string and evalutes it based on the input


### Notes
I know this probably does not follow the best principles of GOLang however I am learning whilst doing this
