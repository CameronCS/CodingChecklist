# This is my Dev Checklist

I want to be able to quite a few things before I would say I'm Proficient in a programming Langauge
So this is my personal checklist to do each of these with as little assistance from AI as possible
All Code will be documented as proof I understand the concepts. 
All AI assistance will be credited aswell.

## Whats the Apps?

### Console
1. Basic Hello World
2. Simple I/O Parsing
3. Calculator
4. Working With data structures such as arrays
5. Working with Text files
6. Running applications with mainloops
7. Database Connection
8. Connection to API's
9. Creation on an API
### Desktop
Note, I currently work on a windows machine and most desktop apps will be windows related.
When I have the change I will have a Linux boot drive and run desktop apps on there if possible so Windows Specific Libraries would be used in some applications
1. Simple Greeting App
2. Simple Calculator
3. An Desktop App using most avaliable GUI controls
4. Connecting a desktop App to a textfile for persistence
5. Connecting a desktop App to a Database
6. Connecting a desktop App to an API
